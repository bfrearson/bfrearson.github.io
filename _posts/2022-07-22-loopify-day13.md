Still messing with the timeline view trying to align the controls (specifically the playhead indicator which should extend over the other views). I need to get it to expand to the width of the container while keeping the timeline in the right place (left aligned).

Tomorrow: Continue working on alignment and add a drag handle/gesture to the circle to update the `$position` state variable
