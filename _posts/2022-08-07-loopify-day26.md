Implemented a method on `Spotify` to retrieve the current playback as a subscriber, but this finishes after the request is sent, so I can't use it to dynamically update the UI...only when checked manually.

Thoughts: I can't use the webAPI to get real time data, so I'm going to have to use either the iOS API or the Web Player API (or I could refresh the view every second, but that seems like the wrong thing to do).
- Think on this more tomorrow, but it seems like we need to go back to the iOS API to get currently playing info, perhaps by making a simple play + track info button (including real time) progress using `playerStateDidChange`

Tomorrow: update the current view with playerStateDidChange (subscribers?)
