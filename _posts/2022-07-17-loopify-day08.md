The above Spotify clone only uses 30s previews in AVPlayer. I think that the initial concept of slowing down the app is not feasible right now. :( However, I'll still aim to create a timeline using the track audio analysis, which is available only through the web API.

Tomorrow: Sketch out some design options for the player before messing with more code.
