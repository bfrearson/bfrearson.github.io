Fixed the Obj-C import, and app launches, but gets caught in a loop authorising with Spotify

I think this is because it tries to connect every time `UIApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification` fires, and the Spotify callback URL will automatically kick back into the app.

Tomorrow: add error handling to the `connect()` method, or work through it step by step to work out what's going wrong. Console is printing **Illegal client_app_id** when calling `spotifyController.setAccessToken(from: url)`
