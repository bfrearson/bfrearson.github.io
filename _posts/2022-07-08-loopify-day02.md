Are there any existing DJ apps?
Are there any existing DJ web implementations?

- Nope. it looks like Spotify have nixed their ability to access raw audio, so I'm going to start with option 1.
- the Amazing Slow Downer still works though and:
	- it operates directly on the stream in real time (it doesn't buffer, as it doesn't work offline)
	- it doesn't play back through Spotify or adjust the "now playing" queue
	- It offers DSP and can speed up
	- HOW?

Reading further, the Spotify iOS SDK hasn't been updated in 2 years, and seems a bit janky. I think probably a webplayer implementation is the way to go...
