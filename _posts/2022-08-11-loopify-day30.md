✅ Can load the currently playing track and seek to any position using the playhead and segment buttons!!!

✅ added regular 1s polling to update position

✅ added basic looper function

Tomorrow: 
- add method to cancel the loop, 
- change the bar segment view to display only the current section
- list and fix error states


TODO: change the bars segment view to only display the bars in the current segment for clearer resolution -> that might need a corresponding scaled progress bar, but maybe play with the design in Keynote before spending time on it.
