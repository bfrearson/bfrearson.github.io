My TestFlight app review was rejected:

- Needed a dummy login for Spotify to test the functionality of the app
- Didn't like bouncing the user out to an external browser for authentication

I think that both of these are a little weird. It's odd that I should have to give login credentials for a service that I don't manage, and also that they are so picky about sending the user to an external browser (where they are more likely to be logged in already. Plus, surely there are many apps that do this.)

Either way, I've complied for now by using `SFSafariViewController`â€”my first piece of UIKit code in this project! It was surprisingly easy to implement actually: just wrap the view controller in `UIViewControllerRepresentable` and drop it into a SwiftUI view!
