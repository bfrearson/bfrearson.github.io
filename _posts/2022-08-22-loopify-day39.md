I've had a rethink about the UI, and so over the past few days been working on mocking that up in a new fork. Because I know that the backend is working, I'm focussing on polishing the mockup, so that the frontend looks generally how I want it, before I wire everything back up.

So far I have the elements where I wantâ€”the next step is adding chrome and tweaking the locations of things (which is harder than it might seem)
