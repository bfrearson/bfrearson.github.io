The scroll-in-play implementation is harder than I thoughtâ€”I would need to debounce whenever the scrollview is scrolled to avoid updating the API hundreds of times per second. ^65a91c

Current solution for v1.0 is to have an independent playhead in `MagnifierView`, but that creates a problem for `MinimapView`, where position and scroll offset are tied together. If I separate them, adjusting position and scroll offset will be annoying.

I think the correct solution is to drop the `ScrollView` and implement a new view myself that has a centralised position and will only fire a position update on `dragEnded`. But maybe this is a feature for v1.1?

The fastest solution, I think, would be to:

- have `MinimapView` as a scroll offset container only (drop the ability to adjust position from there)
- add a moveable playhead to `MagnifierView`
- Have a scroll-in-play toggle to scroll to playhead position when position changed (but disable this when the scrollview is touched)

- Create a new fork for real scroll-in-play once v1.0 is released.
