It turns out that `Timer`  is far too inaccurate to use for short loops. 
Instead, I think [AudioKit](https://github.com/AudioKit) might be a good option, using something like a MIDI sequencer to play "nothing," loop that, then fire `Spotify.seek` when the MIDI sequencer loops.

This should be a new branch and for version 1.1.

TODO: Polish up the UI and build out the loop functionality. It's not perfect at the moment, but it does work.
- Add loop start/end sliders
- resize bars view to only show section
- Add drag gesture to segments over the loop bar area
- Remove debug information and stylise controls

I'm at a point where I'm not sure how to progress to the next point, as there are a few small issues that stand out. I think **tomorrow**, I should go back to my original mockup and create exactly what I want for Testing/Release.
