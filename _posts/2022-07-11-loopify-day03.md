Work though [iOS SDK tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/ios/quick-start/)

Tricky because it's Obj-C framework and the tutorial is for UIKit in Swift, rather than SwiftUI. I found a SwiftUI version [here](https://github.com/tillhainbach/SpotifyQuickStart), but struggling to import the Spotify SDK into the project.

Will keep working at it tomorrow.

Annoyed that the SDK hasn't been updated in 17 months...hopefully the project isn't abandoned.
