Received access token and used it to get track data in a playground! ðŸŽ‰

Had some issues with data racing, so used async/await.

Tomorrow: Bring methods into project and call the track analysis method on `PlayheadNavigationView()` to show track data in real time.

TODO: Implement error handling throughout the `SpotifyWebAPI` object, as there are many ways it could fail right now!
