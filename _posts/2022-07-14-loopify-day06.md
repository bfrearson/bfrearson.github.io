Managed to get a live update of `playerState` and the play/pause toggle will switch when the Spotify app changes state. But it's not two-way yet.

I need to use `getPlayerState(SPTAppRemoteCallback)` which takes a callback as a [parameter](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/ios/guides/making-remote-calls/). I've got this as a closure, not I just need to access the bool that represents the player state.

Tomorrow: figure out the callback syntax and implement this as an object with params for convenience.
