Started adding scroll-in-play to `MagnifierView`. I spent most of today trying to use `GeometryReader` to expose the [ScrollView offset](https://www.fivestars.blog/articles/scrollview-offset/), but I think I only need that for the last point below:

- Create an invisible playhead that represents current position with an ID that can be addressed by ScrollViewReader
- On Position change, update the position of the invisible playhead and use `ScrollViewReader(scrollTo:)` to jump to the id of the playhead.
- On scroll, set the position to the current scroll offset

Tomorrow: work through each of these steps in turn.
