Generalised `sectionView` into `SegmentView` to apply to all `TimeUnit` instances.

Created a (rudimentary) shade change to differentiate between segments.

Next step: create some kind of timeline view (sketch/design/research it first)
- For now, just have simple major and minor tick marks (don't worry about labels) and an arrow/chevron attached to a line that stretches across the entire VStack.
