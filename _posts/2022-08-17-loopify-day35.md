Completed basic LooperView. Thinking about what happens when a loop is changed. Logic's cycle works like this:
- Start playhead has no effect on anything: it just serves as a the in point for the loop, and isn't bothered again until it's time to loop
- End playhead similarly doesn't do anything until the playhead reaches it.
	- I don't think I can do that with timers, as there's no way to know precisely where the current playhead is. The current solution is to restart the looper when the loop is adjusted. **Leave this until 1.1**

Tomorrow: I started adding [drag and drop support](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/ondrop(of:istargeted:perform:)-982eu), the next step is adding an `onDrop()` view modifier to the LooperView and building a drop delegate to handle when the drop region is active (when the finger is within the bounds of LooperView).
