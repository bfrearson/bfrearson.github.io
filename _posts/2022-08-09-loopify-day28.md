No luck. I'm not clear on the update model in my head. The `PlayheadNavigationView` isn't working because I've not clearly defined whether it should take a binding, an environment object, or a fixed property (that would then be redrawn by its parent view on any state changes to that view).

If each view is attached to the environment object, it means that each one is independent of the others, and will update only when one of the published properties there changes. But the `ProgressSlider` needs thinking about because it needs to have a locally-mutable state to allow for dragging. (Perhaps a computed property in `spotify`?).

Tomorrow: post on stackexchange and hacking with swift for suggestions. This will probably take the whole hour. Try the above reasoned idea of having everything tie back to the EnvironmentObject.
