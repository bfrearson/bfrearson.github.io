Ok, the API works, and successfully downloads track analysis payload, but I'm not sure I like or need the `SpotifyWebController` class...it seems a bit redundant as an intermediary between the underlying `SpotifyAPI`. I've also not managed to get SwiftUI Views to update when the track analysis payload arrives.

I also have to run the track analysis download as part of the completion handler on authorize, to make sure they run on the same thread. Otherwise they try and run asynchronously, which obviously causes an error.

Tomorrow: Write out a program flow to ensure that things run and update in the correct order.
