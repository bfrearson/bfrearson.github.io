Added pinch to zoom

to do: 
- [x] the scroll gesture is overriding the loop-dragging. Create a custom tap and drag gesture on LooperView using [`SequenceGesture`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/composing-swiftui-gestures)
- [x] Hook up SegmentView gestures: tap to seek, double tap to set loop, (drag across multiple to set larger loop)
- [x] Hook up track info
