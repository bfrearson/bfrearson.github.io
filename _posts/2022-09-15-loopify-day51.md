Added a timer to `spotify` which changes polling interval depending on the play state

Next: 
- add conditional/fallback displays to `PlayerView` for various play states
	- track details: replace all text with placeholder message (only display text if track != nil)
		- track info: "-"
	- minimap: show nothing
	- magnifier: 
		- looper: no handles
		- segment: no segments


scratch: Current state of app launch:
- position/duration timer is wrong (fixed at 0:30/03:25)
- position playhead is fixed and unmoveable
- segment views don't load until a change of zoom or scroll (presumably, the view isn't getting a state variable)
- interactions aren't working (play/pause, seek, looping)
