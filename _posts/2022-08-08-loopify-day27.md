*sigh* the iOS API does work, but `playerStateDidChange` only updates on play/pause or new track, so isn't going to work for updating the progress ‚ùå

Began updating the view model to take track and analysis data from the webAPI object directly, which I will update every second to grab new position data. Probably won't be quite in sync, but it'll be good enough I hope.

Tomorrow: continue to work towards getting pseudo realtime position data, and sending a position update on section presses. ü´†
