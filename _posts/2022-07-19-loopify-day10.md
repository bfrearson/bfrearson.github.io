Split out `sectionView` as a subview in `playheadNavigationView`. Built the basic structure. Trying to work out how to differentiate between adjacent sections. It's very easy to get caught up in balancing obsessing over details and moving on with a prototype.

Tomorrow: implement a way to create an array of shades from a base colour and apply a different shade to each. (Define a min and max brightness value, define a number of palette options, create an array starting on the default value and increasing in brightness, then decreasing, back to the start)

Next step: pull `sectionView` into `playheadNavigationView` and repeat the process with `barView` ==Actually, this should probably be the same generic view type, as the layout options wills be the same!==
- I'll probably need to modify the `Track` struct to make `Section` and `Bar` subclasses of a more generic `timeUnit`
- modify `sectionView` to become `unitView` and take `timeUnit` as a parameter
