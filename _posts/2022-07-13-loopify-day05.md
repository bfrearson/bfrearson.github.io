Fixed the callback issue. I had the wrong bundle id set in Xcode 🤦🏻‍♂️

Today I started working on adding a label to the app to show player state

(Bug: The callback url kicks the app back to a previously installed version...not sure if this was a one-off from changing the bundle-id as I'd hope that Xcode otherwise replaces previously installed builds.)

Tomorrow: get the player state working and maybe add a toggle for play/pause
