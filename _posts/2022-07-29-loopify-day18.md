Trying to fix compile issues with frameworks. So far I think there are two independent issues:

- ios SDK has(had?) issues trying to compile for simulator and iOs at the same time. apparently this isn't allowed...I *think* I solved this by linking directly to the framework file, and not the entire directory, but I need to double check.

~~Tomorrow: *sigh* keep trying to fix this issue!~~
Fixed: Had to include a forked branch that properly supported Swift Package Manager. These dependencies suck. 

the webAPI uses Combine and returns `AnyPublisher` items, which I don't know how to access the values of. I think tomorrow I'll read an intro to Combine...

#### Later...
No errors, but not able to successfully make a connection to Spotify in the SwiftUI Preview (understandably)

Tomorrow: work on device to test API connections (currently stuck in a loop with the local SPT iOS API bouncing between apps)
