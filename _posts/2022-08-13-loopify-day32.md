Implemented loop logic and button, but there is an issue in that it's not super consistent. I'll add some debug statements to figure out whether it's a network issue or threading, or perhaps to do with the 1 second polling offset?

TODO: ❗️There's a huge issue in that if you leave the app active and looping, it could mess with normal spotify usage. Need to cancel those timers at some point after the app becomes inactive.
