I can check for playlistItem.track using the weird [if case let](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-if-case-let/) syntax. I think I can solve problem 2 by adding a computed property in the `spotify` object. However, I'm not able to get any playlist item data from the api. The last checked-in build on Main (with the old UI) does run correctly, so I'm a bit confused!

~~Working assumption is the my `getCurrentPlayback` doesn't seem to be called anywhere in the new UI version, so I'm trying to figure out where that might be.~~
- Aha: in the old version, I was calling `.onReceive(timer){spotify.getCurrentPlayback()}`
	- Not sure that this is the best option really (reloading the entire top level view every second)
		- Would it be better to: call getCurrentPlayback in `spotify(init)` and then have a timer running within the `spotify` object that changes depending on its state (playing, looping, paused, no active player)?

tomorrow:
- Added `getCurrentPlayback` to the `spotify(init)`, but I still need a placeholder, or to otherwise deal with the optional Track, as it doesn't get the Combine Publisher message back before the view appears.
