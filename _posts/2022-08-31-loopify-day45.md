`MinimapView` now correctly adjusts the scroll offset in the `MagnifierView` window. However, I'm struggling to have things work in reverse. Because it's a scrollview, I have to use `scrollTo(id:)` to move the position and I end up in a loop if I try and update the offset from my new scroll position.

Tomorrow: remove scrollview entirely and instead have a fixed frame with a height of `zoomMultiplier * geometry.szie.height`. Adjust the offset of this based on the `scrollOffset` parameter with a drag gesture. Hopefully with an animation it'll be passable! ðŸ˜…

Next (as day 43): 
- add moveable position playhead to `MagnifierView`
- Have a scroll-in-play toggle button (instead of global zoom)
