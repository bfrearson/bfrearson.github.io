Created a new branch to try and implement my own simpler version of the WebAPI. I only really need to get track analysis, so it seems better than having to deal with confusing Combine all the time.

Able to download a token payload in a playground. 

Tomorrow: 
- Create a token struct to contain the access token and expiration time and decode from the JSON response
- Create a method to get track analysis data using the access token
