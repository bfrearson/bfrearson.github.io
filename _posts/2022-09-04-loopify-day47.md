Finally managed to fix the scroll issue using [this package](https://github.com/TimmysApp/ScrollViewStyle) suggested on my [stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73706750/swiftui-scrollview-gesture-recogniser)(this might also allow [[#^65a91c|scroll-in-play]] to be implemented quickly)! 🙌🏻

Added moveable position to minimap view.
