<h1> Hi I'm Ben.<br>
I like to solve problems.</h1>

I've worked as an [electronics engineer](https://laney.co.uk), teacher, [examiner](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org), [pastor](https://thebcec.org.uk), and independant [software developer](/projects/). At the heart of each of these roles was my goal to fix things[^1].

Most recently I've been working on [Loopify](/projects/loopify/): a song looper that uses Spotify's [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). Born from my frustration with skipping back and forth trying to [learn new songs](https://www.instagram.com/ben.frearson/), Loopify was created as a SwiftUI app that aims to make it easy to identify sections and bars of a song playing on any Spotify Connect device. You can find out more on the [projects](/projects/) page.
